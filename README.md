The goal of the tech interview is to get a feel for how you approach development, providing a platform to talk through common, day-to-day challenges and the technologies we use to solve them.
This is a highly practical exercise. To prepare, we're asking that you build a small web component, a product "card", using HTML/CSS/JS. Then, during the interview we'll ask you to extend that with a few new features, talking through your thought process. You are totally free to use any resources at your disposal—search the web, look up something in a book, even ask us questions. Use the tools you are comfortable with.

Step 1.
Create markup and styles for a “product card” that shows a product image, title, price, and rating. You can choose products you want to display and their details. The products could be clothes, sporting items or even books 😊
When hovering over the card the image should fade out and show an “Add to Cart” button.
During our tech interview, we will add a small level of interaction to the card using JavaScript. Feel free to use jQuery, React, Vue.js, or any other libraries you like (or vanilla JS).

We expect the setup to be running during the interview. Be prepared to demo and add more features.
